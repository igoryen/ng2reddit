1. #newtitle and #newlink are passed as variables into the addArticle().
    input named "title" is bound to variable "newtitle".
    input named "link"  is bound to variable "newlink".
    #newtitle and #newlink are called a resolve.

    "newtitle" and "newlink" are objects of type HTMLInputElement.
    Their values can be gotten as newtitle.value.
    They represent <input> DOM elements.

2. on click, invoke the function with 2 parameters.

3. The column with the number of votes

4. The article information.

5. the host of the Component.
    What document element this component is attached to.
    e.g. the host element - <app-article> tag - will have 
    class="row".
    "row" is a CSS class.
6. of type Number. Represents the sum of all upvotes, minus the downvotes.

7. Title of the article. Of type String.

8. The URL of the article. Of type String.

9. Constructor. Has default values.
    Commented out after adding of #24.

10. Two functions for voting.

11. This says "Don't propagate the event."
    This is a view-specific piece of logic.
    Model Article should allow voting apart from the specific view.

    Without this, the browser reloads the page on every click,
    and the number of votes returns to the default one in the constructor.

    The reason: the JavaScript's default action is
    to propagate the click event to all the parent components,
    and the web browser tries to follow the empty link and refresh the page.

    To stop this, the click event handler must return false.

12. This file is an attempt to isolate the data structure
    from the component code.
    This data structure represents a single article.

13. This is a plain class. Not an Angular Component.
    This is the M in the MVC.

14. The question mark means that the parameter is optional.

15. The default is 0.

16. a reference to an Article.
    A property of the Component.

17. Incrementing/Decrementing happens not on the Component,
    but on the instance of Article class.
    Commented out because they break the Law of Demeter:
    "A given object should assume as little as possible
    about the structure or properties of other objects."
    They change the article's internal properties directly
    and thus they break the encapsulation of the Article class.
    Thus, the ArticleComponent component knows too much about
    the internals of class Article.
    This is fixed by adding the voteUp() and voteDown() on 
    class Article.

18. This function is on component Article.
    It relates to the component view.

19. This function is on class Article.
    It defines what mutations happen in the model.

20. This logic is moved out of the Component into the Model
    in acc. with the MVC guideline "Fat Models, Skinny Controllers".
    The components must do the minimum work possible.

21. the 'articles' is an array of articles.
    Another spelling: Array<Article>.
    This pattern is called 'generics' (as in Java, C# etc.).
    The Array is a collection, and this collection is typed,
    i.e. this array will only hold objects of type 'Article'.

22. A list of Article models.

23. Hardcoding a particular Article in the constructor.
    This is temporary.

24. The Input annotation.
    Now the AppComponent can store an array of 'articles'.
    Now if we had 2 articles (article1 and article 2)
    we can reuse the 'app-article' component
    by passing an 'Article' as a "parameter" to the component,
    like this:
    <app-article [article]="article1"></app-article>
    <app-article [article]="article2"></app-article>.

    Now if you assign an Article to variable myArticle
    you can pass it to the ArticleComponent in your view.
    <app-article [article]="myArticle"></app-article>.
    Here, [article] is the name of the input.
    "myArticle" is the value of the attribute.
    Now, variable myArticle is passed as a parameter (i.e. input)
    to your components, or in other words 
    the 'this.article' on the ArticleComponent instance 
    will get (=) myArticle.

25. using *ngFor directive to render multiple components.
    'articles' is defined in the ArticleComponent.
    'article' is the name of the field defined on 'inputs' of the ArticleComponent.
    'a' is created by ngFor. 'a' is a temporary local variable 
    to hold each array element.
    Using the [inputValue]="inputValue" expression. 
    Setting the 'article' input to the value of 'a'.
    The 'article' input gets the value of 'a'.
    ngFor generates a temporary variable 'a' and then
    we pass it in to <app-article>.
